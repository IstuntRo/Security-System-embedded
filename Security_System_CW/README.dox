@mainpage Security System (Intruder Alarm)

@author Tiberiu Simion Voicu, Ioakim Ioakim

Our system models a security system. Initially the system shows a welcome message 
on screen. When the button is pressed the PIR sensor is initialized and when it 
detects someone it turns on the lights and prompts for a password. If a wrong 
password is inserted then the alarm starts and prompts for a password again. When 
the correct password is inserted the door opens.

Our system when initialized waits for an interrupt to be activated from pressing 
the button and then when the PIR sensor scans someone it sends an interrupt to 
ask for a password. Moreover every touch interaction is processed through interrupts.

Hardware used:

	-STM32f7 â€“ Discovery Board
	-PIR sensor (2pts)
	-2 LEDs (1pt)
	-Buzzer (1pt)
	-DC motor (2pts)
	-Button (1pt)
	-Touchscreen (1pt)
	-GLCD (1pt)
	-Interrupt (2pts)
	-Total of points: 11
