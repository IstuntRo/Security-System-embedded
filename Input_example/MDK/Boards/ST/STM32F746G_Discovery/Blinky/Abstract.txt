The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS based example for
ST 'STM32F746NG' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F746G-Discovery' Kit.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           216.00 MHz

 - LED is blinking
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F746 RAM:      configured for on-chip SRAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F746 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
